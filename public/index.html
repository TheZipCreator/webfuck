      Hello. I decided to spend this weekend implementing brainfuck as a CGI, because I have too much time on my hands.<br>
      So, you can run normal brainfuck code, like this:<br><br>
      <?bf
        ++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.
      ?>
      <br><br>
      In PHP the flow statements (if, while, etc.) can control which elements appear, and we can do that here too:<br><br>
      <?bf
        [-]++++++++++[
      ?>
        Hello
      <?bf
        -]
      ?><br><br>
      As you can see, that got duplicated 10 times, due to the brainfuck code surrounding it.<br>
      However, there's also some new additions to brainfuck, specifically directives and comments.<br><br>
      <?bf
        ;this is a comment. They're started with a semicolon, and ended with a newline.
        
        ;the following is a directive, the "echo" directive, which just puts its contents onto the page
        #echo "This is an echo directive!"
        ;by default, all non-brainfuck code is already wrapped in an echo directive.
      ?><br><br>
      Echo isn't the only directive however, there's a few others, such as in<br><br>
      <?bf
        ;the in directive takes a file and adds it to stdin. If stdin is empty, the brainfuck ',' command puts -1 into the cell.
        #in "lorem_ipsum.txt"
        ;Cat program that terminates on -1
        ,+[-.,+]
      ?><br><br>
      But what if you want to save data? Well, that's where the save directive comes into play.<br><br>
      <?bf
        >
        ;load 65 (A)
        ++++++
        [
          >++++++++++
          <-
        ]>+++++
        ;move 65 to next 4 cells
        [
          >+>+>+>+
          <<<<-
        ]
        ;change to ABCD
        >.>+.>++.>+++.
        ;save to data.bin
        #save "data.bin"
        ;now delete the data
        [-]<[-]<[-]<[-]
      ?><br><br>
      So now we have our data saved in test.bin. Now how do we load it back out? That's what the load instruction does. It resets the head to 0 and loads a file from storage<br><br>
      <?bf
        ;load back our data.bin
        #load "data.bin"
        ;move back to our characters
        >>>>>>>>>
        ;and print them
        .>.>.>.
      ?><br><br>
      So that's about all I have implemented so far. Source code is available at
